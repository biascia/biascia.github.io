## About Me

I'm a Data Scientist and Research Engineer at Verizon Connect in Florence, Italy, specializing in optimization algorithms, vehicle routing problems, and AI applications including Large Language Models.

My research focuses on:
- **Optimization Theory**: Cubic regularization algorithms and adaptive methods for unconstrained optimization
- **Vehicle Routing Problems**: Novel algorithms and independent move-based approaches for large-scale logistics
- **AI & Computer Vision**: Deep learning for crash detection, tailgating detection, and telematics data analysis
- **Large Language Models**: LLM applications for enterprise solutions and intelligent systems
- **Applied Machine Learning**: Real-time logistics management and automated 3D packing optimization

I hold a PhD in Computer Science from Università degli Studi di Firenze, where my thesis explored adaptive cubic regularization algorithms. My work bridges theoretical optimization with practical applications in fleet management and intelligent transportation systems.

## Recent Work

My recent projects span multiple domains:
- LLM-powered applications for enterprise workflow optimization
- Multimodal crash detection using vehicular sensor data and video
- Real-time vehicle tailgating detection systems
